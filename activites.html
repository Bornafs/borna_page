<h1>Areas of Expertise</h1>

<p>
This platform presents engineering, research and technical activities
focused on energy systems, thermodynamics and thermal processes.
Its objective is to support analysis, expertise and knowledge development
in the field of thermal and energy systems
</p>

<h2>Engineering & Technical Expertise</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Applied thermodynamics</li>
    <li>Energy systems analysis and optimization</li>
    <li>Heat pump systems</li>
    <li>Cogeneration and combined heat and power (CHP)</li>
    <li>Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC)</li>
    <li>Refrigeration and cooling systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Consulting & Studies</h2>
<p>
Engineering studies, technical assessments and feasibility analyses
related to thermal systems, energy efficiency and system performance.
Consulting activities are oriented toward technical evaluation and
decision-support rather than commercial services.
</p>

<h2>Research & Knowledge Development</h2>
<p>
Activities include research-oriented studies, modeling approaches,
technical documentation and the preparation of scientific and technical articles
related to thermal and energy systems.
</p>

<h2>Training & Knowledge Transfer</h2>
<p>
Technical training and knowledge-sharing activities covering
thermodynamics, HVAC, refrigeration and energy systems,
with an emphasis on fundamental understanding and practical applications.
